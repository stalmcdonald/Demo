    <h2 >1.  What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.?</h2>
    		<p>Productivity, Games(of course), Utility and Photography(Camera/Video) Apps.</p>
    		
    <h2 >2.  What are the 'top selling' app categories in Japan?</h2>
    <p>Entertainment, Social Networking, Utilities, Photography, Music Apps</p>
    
    <h2>3.  What are the 'top selling' app categories in Great Britain?</h2>
    <p>Lifestyle, Productivity and Game Apps.</p>
    
    <h2>4.  Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</h2>
    <p>Games seem to be a big part of the app market followed by productivity.  People are looking for applications that make their lives easier by simplifying common tasks.</p>
    <h2>5.  What percentage of Android users have the latest/greatest OS in the U.S? in Japan? in Great Britain? How might these differences impact development?</h2>
    <p>Although there have been quite a few updates since Gingerbread.  There are many phones and developers still using the Gingerbread Platform.  Ice Cream sandwich has not seen a huge platform use at the moment.  I suspect it will be more active when more phones offer this platform.  Android doesn't have a history of keeping up with the latests updates. About 4% are using the latest update.  </p>
    <h2>6.  What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?</h2>
    <p>Wow, I am really surprised by the bandwidth costs from country to country. There are real huge differences.  The average bandwidth costs in the USA are about $8. Japan $0.27. Great Britain(UK) $20. </p>
   <p>7.  What would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</p>
   <p>I think my strategy would be to do major research.  Creating apps that make like easier for users such as productivity apps.  Also follow news regarding popular apps that are in decline may create prime opportunity to offer alternative to an existing popular app. For example.  Lightbox and Instagram are very popular Photography Apps and PhotoStream App was available to pick up the influx of users who migrated over after the Facebook acquisition.  Also, creating apps that provide cross-platform services seem to be helpful too. </p>
